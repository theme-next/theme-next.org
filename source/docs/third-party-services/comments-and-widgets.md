      fb_admin:     #<user_id>
      like_button:  #true
      webmaster:    #true
    ```

2. Then set the value `enable` to `true` in `facebook_comments_plugin` section, and change following options below:

    ```yml next/_config.yml
    # Facebook comments plugin
    # This plugin depends on Facebook SDK.
    # If facebook_sdk.enable is false, Facebook comments plugin is unavailable.
    facebook_comments_plugin:
      enable:       false
      num_of_posts: 10    # min posts num is 1
